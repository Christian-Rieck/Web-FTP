Web-FTP - General Information
-----------------------------

Requirements
------------

My Web-FTP script requires PHP 5.x and up and with user feature, you'll need a MySQL Database with MySQLi support.

Installation
------------

So far, it doesn't give a installation routine or something else, it's only copying the files on your webserver and replace the information of the MySQL Database

Documentation
-------------

It doesn't give a documentation too, because the whole project will be restructured the next weeks with the MVC Pattern.
