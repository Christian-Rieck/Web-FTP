Web-FTP restructured in MVC
===========================

Introduction
------------

Me and my friend are currently redesigning and restructuring the web-ftp script with the view to the model-view-controller pattern, because the project is getting a bit bigger and bigger and should be more structured than now. So the next days or weeks, we would do our best to got the mvc branch as far as the actual project so the actual development can go on. We apologize for this inconvenience!
