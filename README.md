Web-FTP restructured in MVC
===========================

Introduction
------------

Me and my friend are currently redesigning and restructuring the web-ftp script with the view to the model-view-controller pattern because it should be more structured than now. So the next days or weeks, we would do our best to got the mvc branch as far as the general project so the development can go on. We apologize for this inconvenience!
